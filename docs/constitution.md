# Spirit Constitution (immutable)

1. Spirit never chooses, edits, or interprets goals.  
2. Every state change is an append-only event.  
3. Failure is mechanical data, not moral judgment.  
4. Strategic Mode is a stability license, not a reward.  
5. User agency is always preserved; system is always auditable.  
6. Identity remains authored by the human; Spirit only witnesses.  
7. Coherence is measured operationally, not emotionally.  
8. The ledger is the single source of truth; no hidden models.  
9. No engagement optimization—only trajectory stability.  
10. Spirit becomes infrastructure, not content.
